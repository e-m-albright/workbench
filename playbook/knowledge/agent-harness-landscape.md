# Agent Harness Landscape — Watch

**Status:** OPEN / ongoing survey. Not an active build — a tracked view of the
coding-agent tooling landscape and where our own harness ambitions sit.

**Last surveyed:** 2026-07-25 · **Next review cue:** when a tracked tool ships a
step-change, or roughly quarterly.

**Project this belongs to:** *own our coding surface.* The install-manifest side
of this watch lives in [`macos/packages.toml`](https://github.com/e-m-albright/dotfiles/blob/main/macos/packages.toml) (the
`AI CLI Tools` / `IDE` sections). This doc is the reasoning and capability view.

---

## The bet

The long-term aim is to **own the coding harness** — the layer between us and the
model — rather than rent it. Owning it buys transparency (nothing injected behind
your back), stability (your workflow doesn't break when a vendor reshapes their
prompts), and eventually **privacy/control** by pairing a self-owned harness with
a self-hosted open model. That last part is a different problem for a different
day (see [local-llm-stack.md](https://github.com/e-m-albright/dotfiles/blob/main/docs/local-llm-stack.md)) — the fantasy endpoint is
wiring a minimal harness like Pi to a Kimi K2/K3-class open model we control.

This is explicitly **not** a bet on agent velocity for its own sake.

## Current stance (2026-07-21)

**Decision: use Pi as the primary interactive trial; retain Codex and Claude Code
as specialist fallbacks.** Do not uninstall either yet. Rationale:

- **Subscription economics are no longer a blocker.** Pi can use ChatGPT-backed
  `openai-codex` auth while retaining its transparent, provider-neutral surface.
- **Pi is now pleasant enough to test as the daily driver.** The restored
  Workbench extensions cover permission policy, safe-git, presets, model routing,
  consult, a rich footer, and the branded startup surface. AGENTS.md and skills
  already carry across harnesses.
- **Codex still owns several hard capabilities:** OS sandboxing, cloud/async
  agents, GitHub PR review, first-class MCP, and some provider-specific controls.
  Keep it installed for those jobs while Pi earns the rest.
- **Maintenance tax remains real.** The Jul 15 move left Pi config symlinks broken
  for a week without an error. Full migration requires Workbench to deploy and
  verify Pi declaratively, not another hand-maintained link farm.
- **No armies/factories of agents.** Large fleets of concurrent agents remain the
  wrong bet. One-to-a-few observable agents, max.

### Guiding principles

- **Velocity is gated by human comprehension, not agent count.** Spinning up more
  concurrent agents doesn't raise real throughput once you can't hold what they're
  doing in your head — it lowers it. More running things makes comprehension
  worse, not better.
- **Maintenance tax is the true cost of owning the bleeding edge.** A self-owned
  harness means every brilliant idea that lands in some other tool becomes work to
  port or forgo.
- **Distance from the frontier is a feature, not a bug.** A harness that
  intentionally separates you from the week-to-week churn is doing you a favor.
  Pi's minimalism is this stance made concrete.
- **Prefer the smallest thing that holds.** Higher-level abstractions that hide
  the agent loop (agent inboxes, orchestrators) are off the table while they hide
  more than they reveal.

## How to read the landscape — tiers

Tools are grouped by **how much they hide** — which is the axis that matters for
the "own your surface" goal.

| Tier | What it is | Hides | Our posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — Terminal harness** | Agent loop in your terminal; you see every tool call | Least | Candidates for a self-owned surface |
| **2 — Editor-integrated** | Agent embedded in an IDE/editor | Some (editor + cloud) | Useful, but not "ours" |
| **3 — Orchestration / inbox** | Manages fleets of agents, worktrees, or an "agent inbox" | Most | Deliberately avoided for now |

---

## Catalog

Everything on the watch list, grouped by tier. The deep-profiled comparison set
(Tier 1, seven tools) has a full capability matrix below; the additions are
catalogued at the positioning level and flagged for later deep-profiling.

### Tier 1 — terminal harnesses

| Tool | Lineage | License | Positioning / why it's here |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pi** | Mario Zechner → earendil-works | MIT | The minimal, transparent, self-extensible core. Our primary "own it" candidate. Sub-1k-token prompt, 4 tools, deep extension API, 3-ecosystem subscription auth. |
| **Oh My Pi** (`omp`) | can1357 fork of Pi | MIT | Batteries-included Rust reimplementation. Already builds most of what base Pi omits (LSP, DAP, subagents, hash-anchored edits) and *inherits* existing `.claude`/`.codex` configs. The "already assembled" version of the Pi bet. |
| **Claude Code** | Anthropic | proprietary | Current daily driver. Subscription (Claude Pro/Max). Mature, deep hooks/skills/subagents/sandbox. |
| **Codex** | OpenAI | Apache-2.0 | Current daily driver. ChatGPT-subscription auth. Real OS sandboxing, V4A `apply_patch`, MCP client *and* server, cloud/async. |
| **Open Interpreter** | Codex fork (Open Interpreter) | Apache-2.0 | Relaunched in July 2026 as a Rust coding agent for low-cost/open models; the original Python computer-use project moved to a community fork. Emulates provider-recommended harnesses (Kimi Code, Qwen Code, DeepSeek TUI, Claude Code, SWE-agent), retains Codex sandbox/MCP/approval foundations, and speaks Codex exec + ACP. Direct Pi competitor at the CLI layer, but differentiated around harness emulation rather than a tiny self-owned core. Very popular and a strong tool to try later; no need to evaluate it today. *Deep-profile pending.* |
| **Amp** | Sourcegraph | proprietary | Frontier-pushing, heavily built-out. Mode-dial instead of model choice; Orbs remote agents; Oracle/Librarian sub-agents. Watch, not adopt. |
| **Droid** | Factory.ai | proprietary | Frontier-pushing. Model-routing philosophy, Missions orchestration, broadest surface (CLI/IDE/Web/Slack/Linear/Jira). Top Terminal-Bench claims. Watch, not adopt. |
| **OpenCode** | sst (Anomaly) | MIT | Vendor-neutral, 75+ providers, client/server + SDK, ACP everywhere, reads `CLAUDE.md`. The open-source neutral option. |
| **Aider** | Paul Gauthier | Apache-2.0 | The OG minimal git-native terminal pair-programmer. BYOK, repo-map, commit-per-change, maintains the Polyglot leaderboard we already cite. Closest philosophical cousin to Pi's minimalism. *Deep-profile pending.* |
| **Gemini CLI** | Google | Apache-2.0 | Open-source terminal agent, generous free tier on Gemini. **Largely superseded by Antigravity** (Google's agentic IDE) — tracking mainly for the local-model/free-tier angle. *Deep-profile pending.* |

### Tier 2 — editor-integrated agents

| Tool | License | Positioning |
|---|---|---|
| **Cursor** | proprietary | AI-native VS Code fork (Anysphere). Subscription. Strong inline + agent modes; increasingly pushing **cloud/background agents** (drifts toward Tier 3). Previously evaluated and tombstoned in our manifest. |
| **Cline** | open source | Autonomous coding agent as a VS Code extension. BYOK, MCP-heavy, plan/act split. Notable as an open, editor-embedded option. *Not host software — lives in the editor, so catalogued here, not in the manifest.* |
| **Antigravity** (IDE) | proprietary | Google's agentic IDE; the successor surface to Gemini CLI. Introduces **agent-inbox / agent-manager** UX — see Tier 3 note. Tombstoned in our manifest. |

### Tier 3 — orchestration / multiplexers / agent inboxes

These manage *fleets* of agents. Explicitly **avoided for now** — they hide the
agent loop and lean into the concurrency-as-progress framing we're skeptical of.

| Tool | Positioning | Our take |
|---|---|---|
| **Conductor** | Mac app that runs many Claude Code agents in parallel across git worktrees | Too much fleet, too little comprehension for us. Tombstoned. |
| **cmux** | Terminal workspace/multiplexer for agent sessions | Didn't beat Ghostty + Zellij session control. Tombstoned. |
| **Cursor agents** | Cursor's cloud/background agent surface | Heavy; hides execution. Not our direction. |
| **Antigravity agent inbox** | Manage/triage a queue of autonomous agents | Hides far too much right now. Firmly not going this way. |
| **[Isomux](https://isomux.com/)** | Visual agent office for coordinating sessions, state, and handoffs | Useful inspiration for one operator doorway, glanceable working/ready/blocked state, and concise evidence handoffs. Patterns mined; do not adopt another permanent orchestration layer unless measured friction creates a concrete need. |

### Open Interpreter vs Pi — overlap, but a different bet

The current Open Interpreter is a direct competitor to Pi in the broad sense:
both are open-source terminal coding-agent harnesses that can run across model
providers. It is not simply “another Pi,” though:

- **Pi minimizes and exposes the harness.** Its value is a very small core, broad
  provider/subscription support, and a deep extension surface we can understand
  and own.
- **Open Interpreter emulates model-specific harnesses.** It is a July 2026 Rust
  fork of Codex that switches among Kimi Code, Qwen Code, DeepSeek TUI, Claude
  Code, SWE-agent, and other prompt/tool conventions. Its value proposition is
  getting cheap/open models closer to the environment they were trained for,
  while retaining Codex-derived sandboxing, MCP, approvals, hooks, skills, ACP,
  and Codex SDK compatibility.
- **For our current setup, it is mostly redundant.** Pi is the transparent daily
  trial, and Codex already supplies the mature sandboxed path. Open Interpreter
  becomes useful if provider-specific harness emulation materially improves an
  open/low-cost model, or if a drop-in self-hosted Codex-compatible agent is
  needed.

**Traction snapshot (2026-07-25):** the repository has about 67.3k GitHub stars
and 5.8k forks, versus about 77.5k stars and 9.5k forks for `badlogic/pi-mono`.
Open Interpreter is therefore a very popular, highly visible project, though not
currently more starred than Pi. Its headline count is partly inherited from the
2023–24 Python project, so it does not measure adoption of the new Rust agent by
itself. The relaunch is active but young: ten Rust releases landed from July
14–18, the latest release assets have roughly 7.2k downloads, and recent merged
work is heavily maintainer-led. It looks like a strong tool to try later, after
the current product has had time to mature.

**Watch trigger:** no action today. Revisit after the Rust product has had a
quarter to stabilize, or sooner if open-model testing shows a material
harness-dependent quality gain.

### Pi vs Oh My Pi — the pair worth knowing

Same thesis ("the model is the moat, the harness is the bridge"), opposite
defaults:

- **Base Pi** — a tiny transparent core you own and build on. Standout perk:
  three-ecosystem subscription auth (Claude Max + ChatGPT + Copilot) in one tool,
  plus 20+ BYOK and local `llama.cpp`. Cost: a rebuild tax for anything beyond
  read/write/edit/bash.
- **Oh My Pi** — a ~55k-LOC Rust fork (single maintainer, young) that has already
  built the rebuild list and **inherits your existing `.claude`/`.codex`/`AGENTS.md`/MCP
  config** natively. The "already assembled" path.

**Key realization:** the "what must I rebuild?" question is really a *base-Pi*
question. Pick Oh My Pi and most of it evaporates — but you take on a large
opinionated fork instead of a small core you own.

### Pi UI surface experiments

- **[@firstpick/pi-package-webui](https://pi.dev/packages/@firstpick/pi-package-webui)**
  — **interesting, but don't migrate now.** Third-party, MIT-licensed local
  browser companion by Firstp1ck. It runs Pi through RPC and adds multi-tab
  sessions, streaming output, model controls, uploads, workspace/Git views,
  extension widgets, notifications, and PIN-gated network access. Its real wins
  are multi-session management and remote access; the terminal footer now covers
  the information-density advantages. Revisit only if those two needs become
  real, and audit the package first because Pi packages execute with full user
  privileges.
- **[pi-gui](https://github.com/minghinmatthewlam/pi-gui)** — okay-ish looking,
  but not compelling enough yet; the visual direction does not inspire an
  immediate switch. It is **not an official Earendil/Pi app**: it is an
  MIT-licensed open-source Electron client by independent developer Matthew Lam
  (`minghinmatthewlam`). It wraps the official `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`
  runtime and keeps Pi session files as its source of truth, but lives in the
  developer's own repository and release channel.
- **[Open WebUI Computer](https://github.com/open-webui/computer) (`cptr`)** —
  **evaluated on mobile (2026-07-25), iceboxed.** Source-available (Open Use
  License) FastAPI/SvelteKit app that drives Pi/Claude Code/Codex alongside a
  terminal, a computer-use browser, filesystem tools, and chat — self-hosted over
  Tailscale. It is genuinely capable and the direction is appealing, but it
  didn't address a pain point we actually have, and the mobile experience (chat
  reliability and the low-contrast, hard-to-read interface) wasn't there for us;
  making it feel good would take meaningful custom-CSS/theming work, since it
  ships no high-contrast option. Paseo covers our daily phone-driving need far
  more pleasantly, so cptr is parked, not adopted. Worth another look if its
  mobile UI matures or we grow into its browser/computer-use capabilities. Fully
  removed from `dfs remote`; if a nicer-looking alternative is wanted later,
  [CloudCLI (siteboon/claudecodeui)](https://github.com/siteboon/claudecodeui)
  is the candidate to trial.

A listing in the pi.dev package gallery means a package is discoverable in Pi's
community ecosystem, not that Earendil authors or endorses it.

### If we ever migrate Codex/Claude Code → base Pi: the rebuild list

Ordered by pain. This is the deferred work, captured so future-us doesn't
re-derive it.

| Severity | What we'd lose | Pi's answer | In Oh My Pi? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | Sandbox + approval gating | **Partly built:** permission-policy + safe-git hooks; still no OS syscall sandbox. Accept explicitly or wrap Pi in Seatbelt/container before retiring Codex. | Partial (prompts + COW, no syscall sandbox) |
| **High** | MCP servers | write/install an MCP extension | Yes (+inherits config) |
| **High** | Subagents / orchestration | tmux fan-out or thin extension | Yes (task/swarm/hub) |
| **High** | Cloud/async + PR-review bot | not locally replicable — keep Codex/CC for this | No |
| **Medium** | Browser / computer use | custom extension | Yes |
| **Medium** | Plan mode / to-dos | `PLAN.md` file pattern | Partial |
| **Medium** | IDE / ACP | RPC/JSON embedding, no shipped plugin | Yes (Zed/ACP) |
| **Medium** | Git / PR workflow | bash or extension | Yes |
| **Low** | LSP / semantic rename | *not a regression* — Codex/CC lack it too | Yes |
| **Low** | DAP debugging | *nobody but Oh My Pi has it* | Yes |

## Inference providers — open-model hosting watch (2026-07-21)

The supply side of the "Pi + open model" bet: who serves Kimi-class open weights,
and who is reputable. Two distinct layers — **routers** (no GPUs of their own)
and **inference hosts** (run the weights on their own accelerated infra).

### Router layer

| Provider | What it is | Reputation / take |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenRouter** | Aggregator/proxy, ~zero own inference. One OpenAI-compatible key; routes each request to an underlying host (or the model owner's API when weights aren't public) by price/latency/uptime. Takes ~5% on credits. | The pragmatic default for a personal agent. You trade an extra hop + a middleman seeing your traffic for provider portability with zero config churn. Prompts pass *through* them to the host; logging is off by default but it's still a party in the path. |

### Inference hosts (own accelerated compute)

| Provider | Tier | Reputation / take |
|---|---|---|
| **Together AI** | Serious infra | Broadest open-model catalog, reliable, good docs, well-funded. Solid default if going direct. Kimi K2.6 at ~$1.20/M in. |
| **Fireworks AI** | Serious infra | Fast, engineering-strong (ex-Meta PyTorch team), competitive pricing. |
| **Baseten** | Serious infra | Aggressive on Kimi-family latency/pricing (~$0.95/M in for K2.6). More "deploy your model" platform DNA; first-class open-weight serving. |
| **Groq / Cerebras** | Raw speed | Custom silicon, spectacular tok/s on small-to-mid models. Trillion-param MoEs are a stretch for their memory architecture — don't expect K3-class there soon. |
| **DeepInfra / Novita** | Budget | Cheapest (K2.6 from ~$0.75/M in). A step down in polish/SLA; fine for a personal agent, not for anything that matters. |
| **Moonshot direct** (platform.kimi.ai) | Model owner | Cheapest first-party access to K3, and the *only* source until weights are public. Chinese company holding keys + traffic — fine for code experiments, mind the privacy line. |

### Kimi K3 status snapshot (2026-07-21)

- Released 2026-07-16, API-first; **open weights land 2026-07-27** (2.8T MoE, MXFP4).
- Debuted #1 on Frontend Code Arena; early days — leaderboards are launch-week
  and frontend-weighted. K2.6 remains the proven agentic workhorse at ~¼ the price.
- Until weights drop, K3 = Moonshot's API only (direct or via OpenRouter,
  ~$3/$15 per M, capacity-constrained). Expect Together/Baseten/Fireworks/DeepInfra
  to serve it within days-to-weeks after 07-27, then prices fall and routing
  through OpenRouter picks the winner automatically.
- **Self-hosting K3 is off the table** for our hardware class (2.8T params);
  the local path stays Qwen-scale — see [local-llm-stack.md](https://github.com/e-m-albright/dotfiles/blob/main/docs/local-llm-stack.md).

## Open questions / to-do (tracked)

- [ ] **Pi browser UI:** deferred. Re-open only if multi-session browser tabs or
      phone/remote access become concrete needs; then audit
      `@firstpick/pi-package-webui` before installing.
- [ ] **Deep-profile the additions** to matrix parity: Open Interpreter, Aider,
      Gemini CLI, Cline, Cursor (agent surface), plus Conductor/cmux positioning
      detail.
- [ ] **Local + open model path:** revisit wiring a minimal harness (Pi / Oh My Pi)
      to a self-hosted Kimi K2/K3-class model for privacy/control. Blocked on the
      open-weights landscape maturing; ties into `local-llm-stack.md`. Re-check
      after 2026-07-27 (K3 weights drop) — see the provider watch above.
- [ ] **Re-verify churny facts** before any decision: model IDs (Amp/Codex change
      weekly), Oh My Pi LOC/stars, "Amp subagent messaging", Pi subagent "parallel
      mode". All flagged as fast-moving.
- [ ] **Revisit the "own the harness" build** when the maintenance tax visibly
      drops (Oh My Pi stabilizes) or a genuine step-change lands. Not before.
- [ ] **Trigger to re-open the decision:** subscription economics change, a
      privacy requirement appears, or Codex/Claude Code degrade.
