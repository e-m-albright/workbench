# Working Files & Agent Artifacts

## Directory: `ai/.agents/`

Working files, plans, and research go in `ai/.agents/` (not the repo root). This keeps the main codebase clean while preserving useful context. Durable decisions belong in curated `docs/` guides; `docs/adr/` is gitignored if tools recreate ADRs there.

> **See also**: `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` for the full two-layer decision organization system.

### Structure

### Rules

1. **Keep the main tree clean** — Working files go in `ai/.agents/`, not scattered around
2. **Date-prefix files** — Use `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` for chronological sorting
3. **Clean up when done** — Delete scratch files after they're incorporated or abandoned
4. **Version plans** — Create new version files rather than editing approved plans
5. **Include attribution** — Note who contributed what for context
6. **Durable decisions graduate to `docs/`** — `ai/.agents/decisions/` and `docs/adr/` are gitignored scratch space

### Attribution Tags

Attribution provides context for future readers (human or AI):

| Tag | Meaning | Context |
|-----|---------|---------|
| 👤 HUMAN | Human made this call | Loop them in before changing |
| 🤖 AI-SUGGESTED | AI proposed | Feel free to revisit |
| 🤖→👤 AI-REFINED | AI explored, human decided | Check the reasoning |
| ⚠️ ASSUMED | Nobody explicitly decided | Validate this |

**Note**: Attribution isn't about creating untouchable rules—it's about knowing who has context.

### What Goes Where

| Content Type | Location | Persistence |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Implementation plan | `ai/.agents/plans/` | Gitignored (or version if useful) |
| API research | `ai/.agents/research/` | Gitignored (or version if useful) |
| Key prompts | `ai/.agents/prompts/` | Gitignored (or version if useful) |
| Code experiments | `ai/.agents/` | Delete when done |
| Debug notes | `ai/.agents/` | Delete when done |
| Conversation logs | `ai/.agents/sessions/` | Gitignored |
| **Architecture decisions (draft)** | `ai/.agents/decisions/` or `docs/adr/` | Gitignored; promote rationale into `docs/` when settled |
| **Decision timeline** | `ai/.agents/decisions/CHANGELOG.md` | Gitignored |

### .gitignore Entry

```gitignore
ai/.agents/plans/
ai/.agents/research/
ai/.agents/sessions/
ai/.agents/prompts/
ai/.agents/decisions/
docs/adr/
```

### What Gets Auto-Discovered

Claude Code automatically loads `AGENTS.md` at project root. It does NOT auto-discover `ai/.agents/`. Reference it in `AGENTS.md` if you want AI to know about decisions and working files:

```markdown
## Project Organization
- Working files: `ai/.agents/`
- Decision history: `ai/.agents/decisions/`
```

### Plan File Format

```markdown
# Plan: {Feature Name}

**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Author**: Claude 🤖 | @username 👤 | Both 🤖→👤
**Status**: Draft | Approved | Implemented | Superseded

## Summary
One-paragraph description of what this plan accomplishes.

## Attribution
- Research: 🤖 AI-SUGGESTED
- Approach: 🤖→👤 AI-REFINED (human approved)
- Constraints: 👤 HUMAN (from AGENTS.md project context)

## Context
Why are we doing this? What problem does it solve?

## Approach
How will we implement this?

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Open Questions
- Question that needs human input ⚠️ ASSUMED

## Related
- ADR: ai/.agents/decisions/000X-related.md
- Previous plan: ai/.agents/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-previous.md
```

### Research File Format

```markdown
# Research: {Topic}

**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Author**: Claude 🤖

## Question
What are we trying to learn?

## Findings

### Option A: {Name}
**Pros**: ...
**Cons**: ...

### Option B: {Name}
**Pros**: ...
**Cons**: ...

## Recommendation
🤖 AI-SUGGESTED: Based on [criteria], recommend Option A.

⚠️ ASSUMED: This assumes [assumption]. Validate with human.

## Sources
- [Link 1]
- [Link 2]
```

### Auto-Index

If you version `ai/.agents/`, maintain a README:

```markdown
# Working Files

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Active Plans
- [Feature Name](plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md) - 🤖→👤 Brief description

## Research
- [Topic](research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md) - 🤖 Brief description

## Key Prompts
- [Auth exploration](prompts/auth-exploration.md) - Led to ADR-0005

## Archived
- [Old Plan](plans/YYYY-MM-DD-old.md) - Superseded by [New Plan]
```

### Prompt Archive Format

When a significant decision emerges from exploration, archive the key prompts:

```markdown
# Prompts: {Decision Topic}

**Related ADR**: ADR-000X
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Initial Exploration
> "Compare Auth0 vs NextAuth vs Better Auth for our use case.
> Requirements: OAuth, magic links, 2FA, self-hosted preferred."

## Follow-up
> "Given Better Auth, design the migration path from our current
> custom auth. Zero downtime required."

## Human Input
@alice: "Also need to support HIPAA compliance for healthcare clients."

## Outcome
See ADR-000X for the decision.
```
