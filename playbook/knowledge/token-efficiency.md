# Token Efficiency & Model Performance

> **Last reviewed**: 2026-04-24 — Refresh when new research or tools emerge.

Strategies for reducing token consumption while improving model output quality. Less context, better results — backed by research.

---

## Core Principles

```
Less input → better reasoning (Levy et al., ACL 2024)
Middle context → systematically missed (Liu et al., TACL 2023)
Forced brevity → +26pp accuracy (March 2026 study via caveman)
Fewer tools → better instruction following (EASYTOOL, 2024)
```

**The counterintuitive finding**: Giving the model *less* to work with often produces *better* results. Every unnecessary token in context competes with the tokens that matter.

## Input Token Efficiency

### System Prompt Discipline

For every line in a system prompt or CLAUDE.md, ask: **"Would removing this cause a concrete mistake?"** If not, cut it.

| Practice | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Prune CLAUDE.md ruthlessly | Prevents instruction dilution |
| Load tools/skills on-demand, not upfront | Reduces per-turn token cost |
| Use deferred tool loading | Schemas only when needed |
| Prompt caching for stable prefixes | 90% cost reduction on cached reads |
| Compress context semantically | 40-58% reduction, 100% fact preservation |

**Each tool definition costs**: 346+ base tokens + schema per request. In a 20-turn agentic loop, 10 unnecessary tools = ~7,000+ wasted tokens.

### Smart Context Selection

- **Agentic search > RAG**: Let the model find what it needs via grep/glob rather than dumping chunks
- **Sub-agents for research**: Investigation in a separate context window reports back a summary, keeping the main session clean
- **Clear between tasks**: Kitchen-sink sessions are the #1 performance killer

### Semantic Compression (Input)

Tools like [caveman-compression](https://github.com/wilpel/caveman-compression) strip predictable grammar from context:

```
Before: "In order to optimize the database query performance, we should
         consider implementing an index on the frequently accessed columns"

After:  "Need fast queries. Check which columns used most. Add index
         to those columns"

Result: 29% token reduction, 100% factual preservation
```

Three methods: LLM-based (40-58%), MLM-based (20-30%), NLP-based (15-30%).

## Output Token Efficiency

### Compression Techniques (Ranked by Aggressiveness)

| Level | Technique | Typical Reduction |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | "Be concise" in system prompt | ~10-20% (often ignored after a few turns) |
| 2 | Structured output formats (JSON/YAML) | ~30-40% |
| 3 | Pattern templates (`[thing] [action] [reason]`) | ~40-50% |
| 4 | Caveman-speak system prompts | ~65% (range 22-87%) |
| 5 | Ultra-compressed abbreviated syntax | ~70-80% |
| 6 | Fine-tuned terse models (oogaboogalm) | Baked into weights |

### The Caveman Approach

[Caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) (45k+ stars) forces compressed output:

```
Terse like caveman. Technical substance exact. Only fluff die.
Drop: articles, filler (just/really/basically), pleasantries, hedging.
Fragments OK. Short synonyms. Code unchanged.
Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].
```

Three intensity levels:
- **Lite**: Professional terseness, grammar preserved
- **Full**: Fragments, articles removed (default)
- **Ultra**: Maximum compression, abbreviated syntax

**Key finding**: Forced brevity doesn't degrade quality — a March 2026 study found it *improved* accuracy by 26 percentage points by reducing hedging and second-guessing.

## Task Decomposition

### Single-Responsibility Prompts

Kitchen-sink prompts (one session, many unrelated tasks) degrade performance because:
1. Context fills with irrelevant information from prior tasks
2. Model attention spreads across competing instructions
3. Errors compound without fresh-context checkpoints

**Pattern**: One task per session. `/clear` between unrelated work.

### Agent Orchestration Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | Trade-off |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Prompt chaining** | Fixed, sequential subtasks | Latency ↑, accuracy ↑ |
| **Router → specialist** | Input type determines handler | Separation of concerns |
| **Orchestrator-workers** | Unpredictable subtask breakdown | Flexibility, more tokens |
| **Fan-out parallelism** | Independent tasks | Speed, isolated context |
| **Writer/Reviewer** | Implementation + verification | Fresh-context review catches more |

### When Sub-Agents vs. Single-Pass

**Use sub-agents when:**
- Task reads many files (research, exploration)
- You want fresh-context review of your own output
- Multiple independent tasks can run in parallel
- Investigation would pollute the main implementation context

**Use single-pass when:**
- The diff fits in one sentence
- Scope is clear and small
- No exploration needed

## Model Routing

### Tiered Routing Strategy

| Task Type | Model | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Triage, classification, linting | Haiku | Fast, cheap, sufficient for simple decisions |
| Pre-commit hooks, formatting checks | Haiku | Sub-second, low cost |
| Code implementation, debugging | Sonnet | Best cost/capability ratio |
| Architecture, complex reasoning | Opus | Highest capability |
| Security review, threat modeling | Opus | Nuance matters, cost is justified |

**Rule of thumb**: Use the cheapest model that produces correct output for the task class.

### When More Tools/Context Hurts

Each additional tool or instruction:
1. Adds tokens (direct cost)
2. Increases decision-making complexity (indirect quality cost)
3. Pushes critical information toward the "lost middle" zone
4. Compounds across every turn of an agentic conversation

## Research & Evidence

### Key Papers

| Paper | Finding | Citation |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Same Task, More Tokens** (Levy et al., ACL 2024) | Reasoning degrades at lengths far below technical maximums | Input padding hurts even when models "support" long context |
| **Lost in the Middle** (Liu et al., TACL 2023) | Information in the middle of long contexts is systematically missed | Put critical instructions at start and end |
| **EASYTOOL** (arxiv 2401.06201, 2024) | Compressed tool docs reduce tokens AND improve tool utilization | Fewer, better-described tools > many redundant ones |
| **Brief constraints + accuracy** (March 2026) | Brief response constraints improved accuracy by 26pp | Conciseness forces precision over hedging |

### Tools & Projects

| Tool | Stars | What It Does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| [Caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) | 45k+ | Output compression via system prompt (65% reduction) |
| [caveman-compression](https://github.com/wilpel/caveman-compression) | 800+ | Input context compression library (40-58% reduction) |

### Anthropic's Own Architecture Decisions

Claude Code's design validates these findings:
- **Deferred tool loading**: Schemas load on-demand, not all upfront
- **Sub-agent architecture**: Research in separate context, summary returned
- **Compaction via summarization**: Prunes conversation when context fills
- **`/clear` recommendations**: Fresh context between unrelated tasks
- **Prompt caching**: 90% cost reduction for stable prefixes (tools, system prompt)

## Deferred Plugins (Revisit List)

Disabled 2026-04-25 to reduce per-session token overhead. All still installed. Re-enable per-session with `/plugin enable <name>` or move back to always-on if the friction isn't worth the savings.

| Plugin | What It Does | Re-enable When |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **feature-dev** | Guided feature development with codebase understanding | Starting a new feature |
| **code-review** | PR code review | Reviewing PRs |
| **code-simplifier** | Post-implementation cleanup | After finishing implementation |
| **pr-review-toolkit** | Comprehensive PR review (5+ sub-agents) | PR creation or review |
| **claude-md-management** | CLAUDE.md audit and improvement | Maintaining CLAUDE.md files |
| **claude-code-setup** | Automation recommender for Claude Code | Setting up new projects |
| **agent-sdk-dev** | Agent SDK app development | Building SDK apps |
| **frontend-design** | Production-grade frontend interfaces | UI/frontend work |
| **playground** | Interactive HTML playgrounds | Creating explorers/tools |
| **security-guidance** | Security review guidance | Security review sessions |
| **explanatory-output-style** | Educational insights in every response | Learning/onboarding sessions |
| **data-engineering** | Airflow/pipeline management (20+ skills) | Data pipeline work |
| **notion** | Notion MCP integration | Using Notion |

**Gap**: Claude Code has no automatic plugin routing (detect task type, load relevant plugins). This is manual. If a plugin is needed >30% of sessions, it should be always-on. Revisit after 2-4 weeks of use to see which ones you keep re-enabling.

**Ideal future**: A lightweight hook or router that detects task type from the first user message and enables relevant plugins automatically. Similar to how Claude Code already defers tool schemas.

## Actionable Audit Prompt

Use this prompt to audit and prune a project's AI configuration for efficiency. Adapt the repo name as needed.

```markdown
## Task: AI Configuration Efficiency Audit

Audit this repository's AI agent configuration (AGENTS.md, vendor entry points,
skills, tools, MCP servers, hooks) for token efficiency. The goal is
fewer tokens in, fewer tokens out, better model performance.

### Phase 1: Measure Current State

1. Count total lines across all CLAUDE.md files (root + subdirectories)
2. Count total .mdc rule files and their combined line count
3. List all tools/skills currently loaded at session start
4. List all MCP servers configured
5. Identify any duplicate or near-duplicate instructions across files

### Phase 2: Prune System Prompts

For each line in CLAUDE.md and each .mdc rule, apply this test:
- "Would removing this cause a CONCRETE mistake?" → Keep
- "Is this general knowledge the model already has?" → Cut
- "Is this a preference that rarely matters?" → Cut
- "Is this duplicated elsewhere?" → Cut the duplicate

Report: lines before, lines after, what was cut and why.

### Phase 3: Audit Tool Loading

For each tool/skill that loads at session start:
- How often is it actually used? (check recent sessions if possible)
- Could it be deferred (loaded on-demand instead)?
- Is its description concise and unambiguous?

Report: tools before, tools recommended for deferral, description improvements.

### Phase 4: Consolidate Rules

- Merge .mdc files that cover overlapping topics
- Eliminate rules the model follows by default (don't instruct what's natural)
- Convert verbose rules to terse single-line directives

### Phase 5: Restructure for Cache Efficiency

- Stable content (tools, core rules) should come first (cached)
- Dynamic content (project-specific, changing) should come last
- Identify cache breakpoint opportunities

### Deliverables

1. Pruned CLAUDE.md (before/after line count, diff summary)
2. Consolidated .mdc rules (merged files, removed files)
3. Tool loading recommendations (defer, remove, keep)
4. Token budget estimate (before/after input tokens per turn)
```
