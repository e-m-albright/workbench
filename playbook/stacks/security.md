# Security — supply-chain & secrets

> Curated taste, not mandate — read this to derive per-project choices.

The cheapest, highest-leverage engineering discipline most projects skip. Three layers: **don't commit secrets**, **don't ship known-vulnerable dependencies**, **keep dependencies current**. All of the defaults below are OSS, self-hostable, and free in CI for small/public repos. Bias: self-host-first, one tool over many, gate the delta not the backlog.

## Selection (pick / avoid)

| Concern | Pick | Avoid / notes |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Secret scanning | **gitleaks** | TruffleHog (heavier; its edge is live-credential *verification* — add in CI only if you need it) |
| Dependency vulns (cross-language) | **OSV-Scanner** (Google) | running every per-language auditor when one tool covers them all |
| Dependency vulns (Go, reachability) | **govulncheck** | keep alongside OSV-Scanner — it does call-graph reachability OSV doesn't |
| Dependency vulns (Rust) | **cargo-deny** (advisories + licenses + bans + sources) | cargo-audit alone (cargo-deny is a superset) |
| Dependency vulns (Python) | **pip-audit** | — |
| Dependency vulns (JS/TS) | **deno audit** / `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` for existing pnpm projects | — |
| Automated dependency updates | **Renovate** | Dependabot is fine and zero-ops *if* you're GitHub-only |
| Malicious-package detection | **Socket** (free GitHub App) | the one SaaS exception — catches typosquat/install-script exfil that CVE scanners miss |
| Secrets at runtime | **Infisical** (or Doppler / SOPS+age) | `.env` files as the source of truth; plaintext secrets in any tracked file |
| SBOM | skip as a solo default | generate on demand (Trivy/syft) only when a consumer requires attestation |

## The disciplines

### Secrets never live in files

`.env` holds **non-secret local config only**; real secrets come from a manager (Infisical/Doppler) overlaid at runtime. `.env.example` carries placeholder **names only**, never values. This makes "did we leak a secret" a structural non-question rather than a vigilance task.

- **gitleaks** runs both as a Lefthook pre-commit hook and a CI job (with `fetch-depth: 0` so the diff is deterministic across rebases).
- **Pin the gitleaks version.** Its action's stock version has historically ignored `[[allowlists]]` array-of-tables syntax, silently turning every documented exemption into a no-op. Version-dependent behavior must be pinned.
- Allowlist **surgically**: each exemption pairs a path glob *and* a content regex *and* a comment explaining why it's safe — so a rule rename or a genuinely new finding still surfaces.

### Provisioning ≠ rotation

Rotating an existing secret has a hot fallback (the old value stays valid during rollover). Provisioning a **brand-new** auth path (e.g. a new service-to-service key) does not — it's a hard failure until the secret exists in every consuming path. So a PR that introduces a new auth path should block on a provisioning checklist (mint → stage in every consumer → verify sync → deploy → end-to-end smoke that expects a 200), not merely on the code merging — otherwise a key that's defined-but-never-provisioned passes review and fails only when first traffic hits it.

### One audit command per language, pinned ignores

Wire a uniform `audit-<lang>` recipe per stack, aggregated under one `just audit` (or `just ci audits`), running only on lockfile change (cheap):

```
cargo deny check advisories && cargo deny check licenses   # Rust
uv run pip-audit                                           # Python
deno audit                                                 # JS/TS
govulncheck ./...                                          # Go
osv-scanner --lockfile=...                                 # cross-language gate
```

When an advisory is genuinely unavoidable, **pin the ignore with a written justification and a removal condition** (cargo-deny's `[advisories.ignore]`, pip-audit's `--ignore-vuln`). An un-annotated ignore is debt with no shelf life.

### Pin third-party CI Actions by commit SHA, not tag

GitHub Action tags are mutable and have been force-pushed to malware in real supply-chain attacks (the `trivy-action` compromise, March 2026). Pin every third-party Action by full commit SHA; let Renovate/Dependabot bump the SHA with a changelog in the PR. Treat bumps to anything touching **transport or security defaults** (auth libs, OTEL, the HTTP stack, an MCP server lib) as manual-review — a semver-silent default change there can be a breaking change discovered only via prod errors.

## Quick reference: adopt in this order

1. **gitleaks** (pre-commit + CI) — blocks the single worst mistake; ~5-minute setup.
2. **One cross-language vuln gate** — OSV-Scanner, plus `govulncheck` if you ship Go seriously; `cargo-deny`/`pip-audit`/`deno audit` per-stack if you prefer native tools.
3. **Renovate** (or Dependabot if GitHub-only) — most vulns are fixed simply by staying patched.
4. **Secrets via a manager**, `.env.example` names-only — the structural fix.
5. **+1 if you touch npm/PyPI/crates often:** the free **Socket** GitHub App.

**Skip as a solo dev:** routine SBOM generation, TruffleHog verification mode, any paid security-scanner tier — those are compliance/enterprise concerns.
