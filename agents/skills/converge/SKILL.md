  adaptations: Expanded from a conversational module-deepening tool into a full measure→diagnose→rank→converge→ratchet→report convergence engine. Deepening is now one move-type in Phase 4. Added references/CONVERGENCE-LOOP.md, references/METRICS.md, references/DE-SLOP.md, references/ONTOLOGY-AND-HIERARCHY.md (synthesized from CodeScene Code Red, GitClear AI-slop data, RefactorBench/SWE-Refactor, SonarSource cognitive complexity, the Mikado Method, Google LSC, Ousterhout, Metz/Dodds). Reuses the repo's health/reviews/*, review health rubric, and engineering-gates ratchet rather than duplicating them.

# Converge

> **Canon** — enacts Principle 10 (*Suppressions ratchet downward*) and Principle 5 (*Simplicity is the goal*); the engine that ratchets the rest in. See [health/README.md](../../../health/README.md).

A **convergence engine**: a repeatable loop that pushes a codebase toward a named steady state — simpler, deduplicated, idiomatic, organized by a real ontology — and **ratchets each gain in** so the next change can't undo it. The aim is code a grumpy 15-year principal engineer would approve without comments: deep modules, no slop, measurably better every pass.

This is the whole-codebase, multi-pass sibling of the diff-scoped tools. Use `/review` to grade a single PR and `/simplify` to clean one diff; use **this** when you want to drive an area (or the whole repo) toward convergence over several passes and lock the result in.

## What it does

Six phases, run as a loop until the area converges:

```
0. Target    — define the steady state (ontology, hierarchy, depth, dependency shape)
1. Measure   — establish/refresh the scorecard; rank hotspots by churn × complexity
2. Diagnose  — fan out parallel audits → candidate "moves"
3. Rank      — order moves: cycles → preparatory tidies → wrong abstractions → de-slop → rename
4. Converge  — execute each move in atomic, behavior-preserving, test-verified steps
5. Ratchet   — lower the baselines, encode satisfied constraints as CI contracts
6. Report    — before/after scorecard; check termination; loop or stop
```

It pushes on five fronts at once, each with a measurable proxy:

| Goal | What it means | Proxy it moves |
|---|---|---|
| **Simplify** | deep modules, errors defined out of existence, less nesting | cognitive complexity, # functions over threshold |
| **Deduplicate** | one home per concept; reuse over re-implement | duplication %, "refactored-vs-added" ratio |
| **Organize** | a hierarchy that screams the domain; names from the ubiquitous language | naming/ontology coverage, package cohesion |
| **De-slop** | strip AI bloat: defensive checks, speculative abstraction, copy-paste | suppression counts, slop-smell count, LOC (honest) |
| **Idiomatic** | per-language taste; acyclic, stably-directed dependencies | dependency cycles = 0, layering contract green |

It does **not** hunt for bugs (that's `/review`) and does **not** invent flexibility for needs that don't exist (YAGNI — see Phase 3). It is **hybrid-autonomous**: it auto-applies mechanical, behavior-preserving fixes and *grills you* on judgment calls.

## Vocabulary

Use these terms exactly in every suggestion — consistent language is the point. Don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary." Full definitions in [references/LANGUAGE.md](references/LANGUAGE.md).

- **Module** — anything with an interface and an implementation (function, class, package, slice).
- **Interface** — everything a caller must know: types, invariants, error modes, ordering, config. Not just the type signature.
- **Depth** — leverage at the interface: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface. **Deep** = high leverage; **shallow** = interface nearly as complex as the implementation.
- **Seam** — where an interface lives; a place behaviour can be altered without editing in place. (Use this, not "boundary.")
- **Move** — one ranked refactoring (deepen, dedup, de-slop, break-cycle, rename-to-ontology…). The unit this skill plans, executes, and ratchets.
- **Convergence** — the area reaches the Phase-0 target and every gain is ratcheted; the move list is empty and CI contracts hold.

Key principles (full list in [references/LANGUAGE.md](references/LANGUAGE.md)):

- **Deletion test** — imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it was a pass-through; if it reappears across N callers, it earned its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.**
- **One adapter = hypothetical seam. Two adapters = a real one.**

This skill is _informed_ by the project's domain model: the domain language names good seams; ADRs record decisions it must not re-litigate.

## The loop

Read [references/CONVERGENCE-LOOP.md](references/CONVERGENCE-LOOP.md) for the full phase mechanics, the Mikado/expand-contract execution discipline, and the termination conditions. The summary:

### Phase 0 — Target (define "done")

Without a named steady state, refactoring churns forever — the empirical signature of unattended agent refactoring is cosmetic renames that leave the design-smell count statistically unchanged. So this phase is a **required gate, not a warm-up**: do one **top-down architectural pass first**, before touching any hotspot. The hotspot ranking in Phase 1 is deliberately local; a codebase can have every hotspot deepened and still have the wrong bounded contexts. Ask the questions no single file reveals: is the context decomposition right? does the top-level structure scream the domain? what cross-cutting concern is smeared across many files?

Then pin the target as **durable, committed artifacts** — convergence is impossible against a target that drifts each run:

- **Ontology** — the domain glossary (`CONTEXT.md`/`CONTEXT-MAP.md`, or a `## Domain Language` section in `AGENTS.md`) and any ADRs in the area. The *naming authority* for modules. See [references/ONTOLOGY-AND-HIERARCHY.md](references/ONTOLOGY-AND-HIERARCHY.md).
- **Hierarchy** — the directory tree as a literal index of the domain (package-by-feature, top-level dirs that "scream" the domain, not the framework).
- **Dependency shape** — zero cycles; dependencies point toward stability (the dependency matrix trends lower-triangular).
- **Depth** — deep modules; errors defined out of existence.
- **The persistent health state** — read `docs/health/<scope>/` first if it exists: `findings.md` (the ledger — skip anything **Tolerated**, don't re-propose open **backlog** items as if new, don't re-investigate **dismissed** ones), the last `report-<date>.md` for context, and `baselines.json` for the current ratchet. Plus `docs/adr/` for declined moves. Re-proposing a recorded decision is the #1 way successive passes (and sibling skills) undo each other — treat this state as shared memory. The convention is in [health/README.md](../../../health/README.md); create the scope dir lazily on first pass.

If the area lacks any of these, say so and create it — naming the target is itself the first valuable output, and the artifact is what makes the loop terminate.

### Phase 1 — Measure

Establish the scorecard so progress is objective, not vibes. Read [references/METRICS.md](references/METRICS.md) for the metric set and ratchet mechanics.

- **Run the deterministic scorecard** to get a reproducible baseline: `scripts/scorecard.sh --json > before.json` (LOC, per-family suppression counts, churn×LOC hotspots; `--deep` also runs any installed analyzers). Re-run it in Phase 6 and diff — this is what makes "measurably ratchet" true rather than improvised.

  > DO NOT read `scripts/scorecard.sh` before running it; it is a black-box read-only tool meant to be called, not ingested into context. Run it with `--help` to see options.

- **Bootstrap or refresh `docs/health/<scope>/baselines.json`** (the committed ratchet). On a first pass, seed every ceiling at the current actual; on later passes, `scripts/ratchet-check.sh docs/health/<scope>/baselines.json` reports any family above ceiling (fails non-zero). This is the operationalized ratchet — see [health/README.md](../../../health/README.md).

- **Take a qualitative baseline grade too.** Numbers miss taste. Grade the area against the `review` health rubric ([../review/SKILL.md](../review/SKILL.md)) for a letter grade (e.g. "B−"), so Phase 6 can report "B− → A−," not just "dup 12% → 7%." The number proves no regression; the grade captures whether a principal engineer would now sign off.
- Beyond the scorecard, detect any other static tools the repo has (cognitive-complexity, duplication, dependency cycles, dead code). Don't invent metrics the repo can't compute.
- **Bootstrap the ratchet if absent.** If there's no `baselines.json`, scaffold one per [playbook/knowledge/engineering-gates.md](../../../playbook/knowledge/engineering-gates.md) (in this repo) or the project's equivalent, seeding ceilings at *current actuals* — then the loop tightens them. This is what makes "ratchet down measurably" real even in a repo with no gates.
- **Rank hotspots by churn × complexity.** Complexity in code nobody touches is nearly free; spend effort where change concentrates (CodeScene's central finding — see METRICS.md). Use `git log` to get churn.
- Emit the starting scorecard (the same metrics Phase 6 will diff).

### Phase 2 — Diagnose

Fan out parallel `Explore` subagents, one per dimension, each returning candidate moves. **In this repo**, point them at the canonical audit prompts in [health/reviews/](../../../health/reviews/) (`god-functions`, `duplication`, `coupling`, `abstractions`). **In any other project**, use the self-contained dimension briefs in [references/DE-SLOP.md](references/DE-SLOP.md) (god functions, data clumps, duplication, weak abstractions, conditional bloat, the AI-slop catalog) and [references/ONTOLOGY-AND-HIERARCHY.md](references/ONTOLOGY-AND-HIERARCHY.md) (coupling, cycles, naming/hierarchy drift). Add a semantic-duplication pass (token → embeddings → confirm) per DE-SLOP.md.

Each candidate move records: files, the friction (in LANGUAGE.md + domain vocabulary), the proposed change in plain English, and the benefit in **locality/leverage** and **which metric it moves**.

Also note **strengths worth preserving** — clever solutions, a genuinely deep module, a clean seam. A convergence pass that only hunts problems will sand off the good parts; name them so no later move erodes them.

Drop any candidate that re-proposes a decision recorded as rejected/superseded in the ADR log (Phase 0). Re-litigating settled decisions is churn, and across the sibling code-health skills it is how passes undo each other.

### Phase 3 — Rank

Order the moves so the effort converges instead of thrashing. Priority (full rationale in CONVERGENCE-LOOP.md):

1. **Cycles first** — they block clean layering; break via dependency inversion or extract-shared-package.
2. **Preparatory tidies with high downstream fan-out** — "make the change easy, then make the easy change." Unblock the most other moves.
3. **Wrong abstractions** — re-inline before re-abstracting (Metz: "duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction"). Treat extract/dedup as *suggested and reversible*, never automatic; honor the rule of three.
4. **De-slop hotspots** — the churn×complexity leaders, deepest modules first.
5. **Rename / relocate to the ontology** — last, once dependencies are clean, so renames don't fight moving code.

Weight within each tier by churn×complexity (impact), leverage (locality gained), and inverse risk/effort.

### Phase 4 — Converge

Execute each move with refactoring discipline (full mechanics + the per-move loop in CONVERGENCE-LOOP.md):

- **Two hats** — change *structure* or *behavior*, never both in one step; structure moves are behavior-preserving and get their own commit.
- **Atomic steps** — decompose every move into the smallest individually-testable edits. LLMs (and humans) fail at big-bang compound refactors; atomic + verify-after-each is what makes it land.
- **Verify after each step** — run the affected tests; tolerate a temporarily-red intermediate state, but always drive back to green before moving on. Verify behavior by tests and structure, never by diff-matching.
- **Mikado for anything non-trivial** — try the move naively; if it fans out, revert to green and record the prerequisites as graph leaves, then work leaves-first.
- **Deterministic tools for the mechanical bulk** — route rote, behavior-preserving transforms (rename, extract, guard-clause flattening, dead-code removal) through codemods (ast-grep, OpenRewrite, comby) where available; reserve your own judgment for *which* abstraction, naming, and semantic dedup.
- **Auto-fix vs grill** — auto-apply the unambiguous, mechanical, behavior-preserving fixes (dead code, unused imports, guard clauses, lookup tables replacing if/elif chains, dedup-to-an-existing-home). Grill the user on judgment calls (a new abstraction, an interface/seam change, anything touching the public surface or an ADR). Default to grilling when uncertain. The grilling loop is the original module-deepening conversation — see below.
- **Arbitrate conflicting moves, don't let the last one win.** These lenses genuinely contradict — dedup pulls against decoupling, deepening against minimalism, DDD richness against YAGNI. When two ranked moves recommend opposite edits on the same code (extract vs inline, split vs merge), that's not noise to resolve by ordering — surface the tension to the user with the tradeoff, decide once, and record the choice as an ADR. Silently resolving conflicts by accretion is exactly the tangled-refactoring failure mode.

**The grilling loop (judgment moves).** Walk the design tree with the user — constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened module, what sits behind the seam, which tests survive. Side effects happen inline:
- Naming a module after a concept not in `CONTEXT.md`? Add the term using the [domain format](../planning/references/domain-format.md). Create the file lazily.
- User rejects a move with a load-bearing reason a future explorer would need? Offer an ADR using the [ADR format](../planning/references/adr-format.md). Skip ephemeral or self-evident reasons.
- Exploring alternative interfaces for a deepened module? See [references/INTERFACE-DESIGN.md](references/INTERFACE-DESIGN.md). Deepening mechanics and dependency categories: [references/DEEPENING.md](references/DEEPENING.md).

### Phase 5 — Ratchet

Lock the gains in so the codebase can't re-rot — this is the difference between a one-shot cleanup and *convergence*:

- **Lower the baselines.** Tighten `docs/health/<scope>/baselines.json` to the new, better actuals — `scripts/ratchet-check.sh docs/health/<scope>/baselines.json --update` lowers ceilings to current counts and never raises them (the monotonic guard, engineering-gates.md). Ratchet reproducible debt counts and explicit per-file ceilings; report total LOC as a diagnostic, not a gate.
- **Encode satisfied constraints as CI contracts.** Once an area has zero cycles or respects a layering rule, write it into the dependency linter (import-linter / dependency-cruiser / ArchUnit / cargo-modules) so a future change *can't* reintroduce it. This is the "cleanup + prevention" step that stops infinite churn.
- **No gaming.** Never strip comments/blanks or launder types to slip under a ceiling; a clean longer file beats a mangled shorter one. When a metric is at floor, do the real refactor or change the *formula* — see the anti-gaming rules in engineering-gates.md.

### Phase 6 — Report & repeat

Re-run `scripts/scorecard.sh --json` and diff against `before.json`; re-grade against the `review` rubric. Show both: the quantitative before/after (LOC, duplication %, #functions-over-cognitive-complexity, dependency cycles, suppression counts, and the **refactored-vs-added ratio** — the de-slop north star, since AI assistants *add* code instead of consolidating and this loop inverts that) **and** the qualitative grade move (e.g. "B− → A−"). The numbers prove no regression; the grade proves it actually got better.

**Persist the run** to `docs/health/<scope>/` so the next pass is stateful: write/refresh `report-<date>.md` (the graded snapshot), and update `findings.md` — move fixed items to the run log, append newly-discovered to the backlog, record anything newly Tolerated (with an ADR) or Dismissed. This durable ledger is what makes successive passes *converge* instead of re-discovering the same findings (see [health/README.md](../../../health/README.md)).

Then check the termination conditions (CONVERGENCE-LOOP.md), one of which is **no move undid a recorded decision**. If the area hasn't converged and the next move still pays for itself, loop. Stop when the move list is empty, the contracts hold, **or** the economics turn (over-tidying is procrastination — the AHA/Tidy-First brake).

## Scope of a run

**Default: a bounded hotspot set.** Pick the top-N churn×complexity hotspots (or a path the user names) and converge *those* to target, then report. Bounded, reviewable, and repeatable — run again for the next set, the way large orgs shard big changes. Don't try to fix the whole repo in one invocation by default.

**Escalation: whole-codebase sweep.** When the user explicitly asks for a full sweep (or the repo is small), widen scope to the entire codebase. For a large repo this is the natural place to escalate to a multi-agent `Workflow` (fan out systematic-debugging across the tree → dedup → verify → ratchet) — but only when the user opts into that, since Workflow is Claude-Code-only. The inline subagent path is the portable default.
