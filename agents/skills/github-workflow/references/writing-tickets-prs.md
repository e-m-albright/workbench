# Tickets & PRs

## Issues / Tickets

- **Title**: What's wrong or what's needed — not how to fix it.
- **Acceptance criteria**: Define "done" in observable terms, not implementation details.
- **Reproduction steps** (bugs): Exact steps, expected vs. actual behavior, environment info.
- **Context**: Link related issues, PRs, or incidents. Include screenshots for UI issues.
- **Size signal**: If it's more than a day of work, suggest breaking it down.

## Pull Requests

- **Title**: Imperative mood, concise (`Add user auth flow`, not `Changes` or `Update files`).
- **Summary**: Why this change exists (1-3 bullets). What problem it solves, not a file list.
- **Risk & scope**: What could break. What was explicitly left out and why.
- **Test plan**: How to verify — manual steps, automated tests, or both.
- **Links**: Related ticket IDs, ADRs, or incidents.
- Keep descriptions audit-friendly — Drata compliance may depend on PR history.

## Commits

- Imperative mood, explain *why* not *what*.
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`.
- One logical change per commit. Don't mix refactors with features.
