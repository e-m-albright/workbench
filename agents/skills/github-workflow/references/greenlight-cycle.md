# PR Greenlight Cycle

You are about to iterate on an open PR until CI is green. Most of the waste in this loop comes from one mistake: pushing first and asking CI what's broken, instead of running the same gate locally in 30 seconds.

## The rule

**Every push that has any chance of failing CI must be preceded by the local equivalent of the gate that would catch it.** The pre-commit and pre-push hook stages are not enough on their own. They are subsets, not parity. Run the actual CI gate locally before you push.

If you cannot reproduce a CI failure locally, that is a parity bug in the hook configuration. Fix the hook, do not paper over it with another push-watch loop.

## Local commands that mirror the merge-blocking gates

Build a mental map of (CI workflow) → (local command). Common patterns by stack:

| Stack | CI gate | Local command |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | clippy + tests | `cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo nextest run --workspace` |
| Python | ruff + type + tests | `ruff check . && pyright && pytest` |
| TypeScript / Web | biome + svelte-check / tsc + vitest | `biome check . && svelte-check && vitest run` (or `npm test`) |
| Generic | full preflight | `just verify` / `just check && just test` / project-specific umbrella |
| PR text / secrets / em-dash | hook scripts | trust the pre-commit hook for these — they're cheap |

If the change spans multiple stacks, run all the gates the diff touches, or call the umbrella recipe (`just verify`, `npm run preflight`, etc.) and call it done.

**Key parity points that bite repeatedly:**
- Test-feature flags: `--all-targets --features db` (Rust) vs plain `cargo check` — only the former catches lints inside `#[cfg(test)]`.
- Workspace scope: `--workspace` vs the current crate only.
- Type-check mode: `pyright` strict vs project default.
- Lint scope: lint-against-baseline vs lint-from-scratch.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the gate that will block your change.** Diff scope tells you this. A Rust-only change does not need to run the Web gate locally.
2. **Run that gate locally and watch it pass.** This is non-negotiable. If it does not pass locally, do not push.
3. **Push.**
4. **Watch the PR with `gh pr checks <num> --watch` or `--watch --interval 30`.** Do not use long-interval polls. `--watch` returns the moment the rollup flips. Run it with `run_in_background: true` if you need to keep working.
5. **If CI fails on a gate you did not run locally:** that is a process failure, not just a code failure. Add the missing local check to your routine and (if it is a recurring miss) propose a hook update.
6. **If CI fails on a gate you DID run locally:** that is a parity bug. Compare commands exactly. Common drift points: `--all-targets`, feature flags, workspace scope, strict mode.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **PR body churn.** Every edit to the PR body retriggers PR-text workflows. Refresh the body once, at the end, after the diff stabilizes. Sibling-agent pushes are not a reason to re-edit, only to re-read.
- **Long polling for CI status.** Setting a 5-10 minute wakeup to "check CI" is a smell. Use `gh pr checks <num> --watch` (foreground) or `run_in_background: true` (background) so you get notified the instant a check flips.
- **Trusting only the pre-commit hook.** Pre-commit hooks are fast smoke checks, not the full gate. Pre-push is closer to parity, but still subsets some checks for speed.
- **Pushing the fix before reading the failure.** Always pull `gh run view --log-failed --job=<id>` for the exact line first. Otherwise you'll fix the wrong thing.
- **Re-running CI to "see if it works now" without changing anything.** If you pushed nothing new, the result will be identical. Read the log instead.

## Sibling-agent races

If multiple agents are pushing to the same branch:

- `git fetch && git log --oneline origin/<branch> -5` before every push. If sibling commits landed, rebase or merge before pushing your fix.
- Commit your fix immediately when ready; do not let it sit while another agent's push absorbs it.
- If a sibling commit broke a gate, fix it forward and credit the cause in the commit message ("Sibling push abc1234 introduced X"). Do not revert sibling work.



## When a check fails repeatedly

Three failed pushes is a parity bug, not a flaky test. Stop the cycle and:

1. Diff the local command against the CI command character-for-character.
2. Look at `.github/workflows/*.yml` and the local hook config (`lefthook.yml`, `.husky/`, etc.) together.
3. Update the hook so the same failure cannot escape locally next time.

The goal is shoot-once-score, not push-watch-fix-push-watch-fix.
