  adaptations: Streamlined from 485 lines to ~230. Stripped sections requiring Anthropic's eval-runner infrastructure (run_loop.py, aggregate_benchmark.py, eval-viewer/, blind-comparison agents, packaging). Stripped Claude.ai/Cowork-specific sections. Kept the meta-knowledge (anatomy, progressive disclosure, writing patterns, style).

# Skill Authoring

Create new skills and improve existing ones. The high-level loop:

- Decide what the skill should do and roughly how
- Write a draft
- Run the skill on 2-3 realistic test prompts (manually or via subagent)
- Read the outputs critically; rewrite
- Repeat until it works

Your job is to figure out where the user is in the loop and meet them there. They might be at "I want to make a skill for X" — start at the beginning. They might already have a draft — go straight to test/iterate.

This skill is the meta-skill. It complements:
- **[Skill format](references/skill-format.md)** — the convention spec for this repo (frontmatter, body, source attribution, tool restrictions). [Agent format](references/agent-format.md) covers subagents.
- **`workbench lint`** — the validator. Run it after every edit to confirm spec compliance.

## Creating a skill

### Step 1 — Capture intent

The current conversation often already contains the workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., "turn this into a skill"). Pull from history first — tools used, sequence of steps, corrections, input/output formats observed.

Confirm with the user:
1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?
2. When should it trigger? (Specific user phrases / contexts.)
3. What's the expected output format?
4. Should we set up test cases? Skills with **objectively verifiable outputs** (file transforms, data extraction, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with **subjective outputs** (writing style, design) often don't need them — qualitative review is enough. Suggest the appropriate default.

### Step 2 — Write the SKILL.md

Use the canonical layout (full conventions: [Skill format](references/skill-format.md); for authoring subagents instead, see [Agent format](references/agent-format.md)):

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          (required — frontmatter + body)
├── scripts/          (optional — black-box executables)
├── references/       (optional — docs loaded on demand)
└── assets/           (optional — output templates)
```

Frontmatter (required: `name`, `description`):

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: <what it does>. Use when <literal user phrases / file types / scenarios>.
metadata:                       # only if ported/adapted
  source_url: ...
  source_commit: ...
  ported_at: YYYY-MM-DD
  adaptations: ...
allowed-tools: Read Grep Glob   # only for read-only skills
disable-model-invocation: true  # only for user-only-invoked skills
---
```

#### Description discipline

The description is the **primary triggering mechanism**. Claude has a tendency to *under-trigger* skills — the description should be a little **pushy**, naming literal phrases the user might say, file types, and concrete scenarios.

**Bad:** *"How to build a dashboard."*
**Good:** *"How to build a fast dashboard for internal data. Use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data."*

For skills at risk of false-firing on adjacent topics, include explicit `Do NOT trigger when …` or `SKIP:` clauses (Anthropic's `claude-api` description is the canonical example).

### Step 3 — Body conventions

- **Imperative voice.** *"Run the script"* not *"The user can run."*
- **Explain the why, not just the what.** LLMs are smart; rote `MUST` / `NEVER` directives are a yellow flag.
- **≤ 500 lines.** If exceeding, split into `references/` (linked one level deep).
- **No surprise.** A skill must not contain malware, exploit code, or anything that contradicts its stated intent. Roleplay/style skills are fine; deception is not.

### Step 4 — Progressive disclosure

Three loading levels:
1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens) — name + description, always in context.
2. **SKILL.md body** — loaded when the skill triggers (≤ 500 lines).
3. **Bundled resources** (`scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`) — loaded only as needed.

Patterns:
- Reference files explicitly from SKILL.md with a labeled link to
  `references/foo.md` and guidance on when to read.
- For multi-domain skills, organize by variant under `references/`:
  ```
  cloud-deploy/
  ├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection logic)
  └── references/
      ├── aws.md
      ├── gcp.md
      └── azure.md
  ```
  Claude reads only the relevant reference file.
- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents.

### Step 5 — Black-box scripts

If bundling executable code in `scripts/`, **always** include this paragraph in SKILL.md:

> *DO NOT read the source until you try running the script first and find that a customized solution is absolutely necessary. These scripts can be very large and thus pollute your context window. They exist to be called directly as black-box scripts rather than ingested into your context window.*

Always run scripts with `--help` first. Look for `--help` to surface options before improvising.

## Testing

After drafting, write 2-3 realistic test prompts and validate the triggers. Read [testing.md](references/testing.md) for test-case format, trigger-query design, and manual validation without an eval runner.

## Improving the skill

### How to think about improvements

1. **Generalize from the feedback.** A skill is meant to be used many times across many prompts. If you and the user are iterating on a few examples and the skill works *only* for those examples, it's overfit. Watch for fiddly example-specific changes vs. principled changes.

2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove anything not pulling its weight. Read transcripts (not just outputs) — if the skill is making the model waste time on unproductive work, cut that part and re-test.

3. **Explain the why.** When you find yourself writing `ALWAYS`/`NEVER` in caps or rigid structures, that's a yellow flag. Reframe and explain the reasoning so the model understands why something matters. More humane, more powerful.

4. **Look for repeated work.** If 3 test runs all produced similar helper scripts, bundle that script in `scripts/`. Write it once; tell the skill to call it.

5. **Validate after every edit.** Run `workbench lint` to confirm the skill stays spec-compliant (frontmatter, trigger clause, body length, caps count).

### The iteration loop

1. Apply your improvements.
2. Re-run the test cases (and the trigger queries if you have them).
3. Compare against the previous iteration — same test prompts, different outputs.
4. Get user feedback. Empty feedback = looks good.
5. Improve, repeat. Stop when:
   - User says they're happy.
   - Feedback is consistently empty.
   - You're not making meaningful progress.

## How skill triggering works

Skills appear in Claude's `available_skills` list with their name + description. Claude decides whether to consult a skill based on the description.

**Important nuance:** Claude only consults skills for tasks it can't easily handle on its own. Simple one-step queries like "read this PDF" may not trigger a skill even if the description matches perfectly — Claude can handle them directly. Complex, multi-step, or specialized queries reliably trigger skills when the description matches.

Implication: trigger eval queries should be **substantive enough that Claude would actually benefit from consulting a skill**. Test "make a 4-page PDF report from this CSV with a chart on page 2" not "open the PDF."

## Source attribution (when porting)

If you're adapting an upstream skill, add `metadata.source_*` to the frontmatter and a `## Sources` footer at end of body — provenance lives in each skill, not a central registry. See [skill-format.md](references/skill-format.md) § Source attribution for the convention.
