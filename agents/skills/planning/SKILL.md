# Planning & Scope

Apply these criteria during brainstorming, planning, and spec review — before writing code. By the time you're reviewing a PR, you've already committed to building the thing. These questions prevent building the wrong thing.

## Choose the mode

- **Pressure-test an idea:** read [ideation.md](references/ideation.md), then surface the strongest alternative and the load-bearing uncertainty.
- **Scope a decision:** use the criteria in this file.
- **Write an implementation plan:** read [writing-plans.md](references/writing-plans.md) after the scope is settled.
- **Grill the user about a plan** ("grill me", "stress-test this design", "interview me about X"): read [grill-with-docs.md](references/grill-with-docs.md).
- **Carry the plan's discipline into implementation:** read [execution-discipline.md](references/execution-discipline.md).

## When to Use

- Deciding whether something is worth building, and if so, what the smallest valuable version is.
- Scoping a task: defining "done", non-goals, increments, blast radius, rollback.
- Choosing between approaches on effort / reversibility / complexity / maintenance grounds.

Use the linked mode instead of loading every reference. Scope first; write a plan only after the consequential choices are settled.

## Should We Build This?

- Does this solve the user's real problem, or just the stated requirement? (ask why, not just what)
- Is this already available as a library, service, or built-in feature?
- What's the effort/impact ratio? (a 2-day feature 80% of users need vs. a 2-week feature for 5%)
- Will this compound? (platform features that enable future work > one-off solutions)
- Are we building optionality or lock-in? (prefer reversible decisions)

## Scope Check

- Is "done" clearly defined? (observable criteria, not open-ended exploration)
- What's the smallest version that delivers value? (the MVP of the feature, not the roadmap)
- What are we explicitly NOT building? (non-goals prevent scope creep)
- Can this be decomposed into shippable increments? (no 3-week branches with one big merge)
- Is this a one-way door or a two-way door? (one-way doors deserve more scrutiny — database schemas, public APIs, data deletion)

## Dependencies & Risk

- What are the blockers? (another team, a migration, an API change, a decision not yet made)
- What's the blast radius if this breaks? (how many users/systems affected?)
- What's the rollback plan? (feature flag, migration rollback, revert commit, or "hope"?)
- Are there deadlines, freezes, or releases this interacts with?
- Does this require coordinated deployment? (multiple services, database + code, config + code)

## Approach Selection

When choosing between approaches, evaluate:

- **Effort**: How long for a human? How long with AI assistance? (be honest about both)
- **Reversibility**: Can we change our minds later? At what cost?
- **Complexity budget**: Does this use up complexity budget on the right thing? (complexity in domain logic is justified; complexity in infrastructure is usually not)
- **Maintenance burden**: Who maintains this in 6 months? Is it obvious or does it require tribal knowledge?
- **Failure modes**: What happens when this goes wrong? Is the failure loud or silent?

When presenting options, include effort estimates for each and a clear recommendation with rationale. Don't present options without a recommendation — that's delegation, not advice.

## Red Flags

Stop and reconsider if you notice:
- The plan has no non-goals (scope will creep)
- "We'll figure that out later" on a load-bearing decision
- The approach requires everything to go right (no error paths planned)
- It's easier to describe what the code does than what problem it solves
- The estimate doesn't include testing, migration, or deployment time
